# Deploy your Webex Share

Use the following workflow as you deploy and install your device. 

Before you begin

Webex Share is designed so you can quickly and easily deploy it in your workplace, but you must be familiar with the documentation. Before you deploy your Webex Share, read the following sections:

- Webex Share Specifications and Requirements
- Webex Share Best Practices
- Supported Browsers for Webex Share
- Supported Languages for Webex Share

| 1 | Prepare your environment for Webex Share. Before you install your Webex Share, create a Workspace and add services to the device. If the activation code has expired, then you generate a new one. If required, you set a proxy and generate a certificate. After you activate the device, you can't access or change your network settings without a factory reset. |

| 2 | Connect and Activate Your Webex Share. Connect your Webex Share to your display screen. Generate your certificates if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3 | Pair your Webex Share. Connect your device to your meeting tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4 | Customize your Webex Share with features. Configure the settings to suit your needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

[Create a workspace and add services for a Webex Share](#task%5F5ADAC86C53073C1F6ADCF934188FD99B)

Before you can use your Webex Share, you associate the device to a physical location. 

| 1 | Sign in to [Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com), then go to Management \> Workspaces and click Add Workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 2 | Enter a name for the workspace (such as the name of the physical room), select the room type, and add capacity. Click Next.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3 | Choose Cisco Room and Desk device, then click Next. You can only have one type of device in a single space. For example, you can add up to 10 desk phones to a lobby or a single Webex Room Device, but not a combination of the two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4 | Choose Call on Webex (1:1 call, non-PSTN) (default). Although a call service doesn't apply to Webex Share, select the default to move to the next step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

For more information, see [Create and manage room mailboxes](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj215781). |
| 7 | Click Next, then activate the device with the code provided. If you use certificates, deploy the certificate to your Webex Share before activating it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

[Set a proxy](#task%5F0DF3155B6BCDADB583B1F8D0A8BF6524)

If your organization uses firewalls, you may want to set up a proxy server so that users can connect with people outside your organization. The proxy is responsible for filtering that connection.

Wired Connection (Ethernet): Your TV shows the Webex Share IP address and prompts you to enter this IP address in your web browser.Wireless Connection (Wi-Fi): Your TV shows the Webex Share Wi-Fi SSID and prompts you to connect to that network.                         |
| - | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 | Access the device webpage. Ethernet: In your web browser (from your laptop or mobile device), enter the Webex Share IP address to access the device page.Wi-Fi: With the provided password, connect (from your laptop or mobile device) to the Webex Share Wi-Fi network to access the device page.                                                                     |
| 3 | Click Set Proxy, click Edit, and fill in the required fields as needed. Proxy: Use a standard URI. Example: example.mycompany.com:80 (Optional) Username: Enter a value if necessary for authentication. (Optional) Password: Enter a value if necessary for authentication. (Optional) Confirm Password: Enter the same password as you entered in the Password field. |
| 4 | Click Save.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

[Generate a new activation code](#task%5F067DB6A2925DA48C716301962F18C972)

You generate your Activation code when you create your Workspaces in Control Hub. But the code expires after 7 days so users may require a new one.

[Webex Share Features](#reference%5FE0A5446217DD537AC8124CCEF7469299)

After you add Webex Share to Cisco Webex Control Hub, you can add functionality to the device. The following table shows some of the supported features.

Some Webex Share features require Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) so connect your Webex Share to a HDMI-CEC port on your display screen. Refer to the screen documentation for additional information.

| Wireless Guest Share | Users share content wirelessly to any Webex registered room device without an account. This feature does not require any configuration. But on some display screens, shared images distort so you may have to adjust your display screen settings. For example, you can adjust the Sharpness setting or change Picture Mode to Computer or the equivalent. For additional information, see the documentation that came with your display screen. |
