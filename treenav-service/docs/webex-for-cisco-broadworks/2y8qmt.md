# Partner Administrator Roles for Webex for BroadWorks

Roles are used to assign administration access to settings in Partner Hub and Control Hub. There are multiple roles available, which can provide access to required administrative settings while limiting access to non-required settings. You can assign multiple roles to a single administrator or multiple administrators with varying roles and access privileges, all according to the organization needs. 

Within a partner organization (Service Provider or reseller), roles can be assigned for two main administration purposes:

- Partner Management—Manage settings that apply to the partner organization.
- Customer Management—Manage settings that apply to customer organizations that the partner manages.

## Partner Management Roles

The following organizational and functional roles grant administrative privileges to manage settings for the partner organization itself (the organization titled “My Organization” in Partner Hub). 

- **Full administrator**—Has access to view and administer settings for partner organization. Can assign administration roles, including roles for Customer management.
- **Read-only administrator**—Has access to view partner organization’s settings, but cannot edit settings.
- **Support administrator**—Has access to Analytics and Troubleshooting.
- **User and device administrator**—Has access to manage users, devices and licensing.
- **Device administrator**—Has access to manage devices.
- **Compliance officer**—Has access to user-generated and legal content.
- **Advanced troubleshooting**—Access to join in-progress and live meetings.

The following table displays the level of access the above administrators have to manage settings for the partner organization.

**Provisioning administrator** is a derived role rather than an assigned role. It can occur if an administrator sets up Webex services for an organization that exists already in Control Hub and which has an existing relationship to a partner and partner admin. The Provisioning administrator has similar access to a Partner administrator. However, do not have access to begin and manage Webex Trials.

## Assign Roles

The Full administrator and Partner full administrator can assign roles to other users in the partner organization. 

The first user provisioned to the partner organization gets assigned both of the above roles automatically and can assign roles to other users in the partner organization.

## Restricted Administrator Mode

Restricted administrator mode is an organization-level setting that partner administrators can enable for customer organizations (the default setting is enabled). When a partner administrator enables Restricted mode for a customer organization, all customer administrators for that organization are restricted from editing a list of partner-defined settings in Control Hub—only a partner administrator can reset the restricted settings. For customer administrators, the level of Control Hub access is determined as follows:

_(Control Hub access) = (Role entitlements) - (Restrictions)_

When Restricted mode is enabled, the following items are restricted for customer administrators in that organization:

- In the Users view, the following settings are not available:

  - Manually Add or Modify Users—No option to add or modify users, either manually or via CSV.
  - Claim Users—not available
  - Auto-assign Licenses—not available
  - Directory Synchronization—Unable to edit directory sync settings (this setting is available to Partner-level administrators only).
  - User details—No option to edit User primary Email address. However, settings such as First name, Last name and Display name are editable.
  - Reset Package—No option to reset the package type.
  - Edit Services—No option to edit the services that are enabled for a user (e.g., Messages, Meetings, Calling)
  - View Services status—Unable to see full status of Hybrid Services or Software Upgrade Channel
  - Primary Work Number—This field is read-only.
- In the Account view, the following settings are not available:

  - Company Name is read-only.
- In the Organization Settings view, the following settings are not available:

  - Domain—Access is read-only.
  - Email—The Suppress Admin Invite Email and Email Locale Selection settings are read-only.
  - Authentication—No option to edit Authentication and SSO settings.
- In the Calling menu, the following settings are not available:

  - Call Settings—The App Options Call Priority settings are read-only.
  - Calling Behavior—Settings are read-only.
  - Location > PSTN—The Local Gateway and Cisco PSTN options are hidden.
- Under SERVICES, the Migrations and Connected UC service options are suppressed.

Restricted mode gets applied to customer organizations, rather than to individual administrators. When this setting is on, customer administrators at that organization see a banner at the top of the Control Hub screen that lets them know that this setting is applied.

Manage Users button will be greyed out for all customer administrators.

If the partner removes the restricted administrator mode for a customer administrator, the customer administrator will be able to perform the following:

- Add Webex for Wholesale users (with the button)
- Change packages for a user

### Configure Restricted Administrator Mode

Partner administrators can use the below procedure to enable or disable this mode for given customer organizations (the default setting is enabled).

1. Sign in to Partner Hub and select Customers.
2. Select the applicable customer organization.
3. In the right-hand settings view, turn Restricted Administrator Mode on or off by enabling or disabling the following toggles:  
Disable the toggle if you want to remove Restricted Mode for the customer organization.

An example of where this may be required is if an existing Webex organization purchases Webex services from a partner organization with whom they do not have an existing relationship. The customer administrator must approve external administrator access to the new partner administrator.
