## June 2025

### Allow any user to be cohost

This setting allows any user with a host license to become a cohost when they join a class meeting.

Previously, only the meeting creator was assigned as a host for meetings scheduled in Webex LTI, so these meetings could only be started when the meeting creator joined. 

Now when you enable the allow any user to be cohost setting, any user with a host license will become a cohost when they join a class meeting. The cohosts are able to start meetings and record class sessions in addition to all other cohost privileges, even if the meeting creator does not join. 

Admins can enable this setting in Registration Hub.

## December 2024

### Delete a registration in Registration Hub

Webex admins can now delete old or unused registrations in Registration Hub. 

Deleting a registration erases all data and information, including courses, users, meetings, and recordings created within the registration.

If a tool associated with a deleted registration is still installed in your LMS, it becomes unusable.

For more information, see [Webex LTI Registration Hub for Webex admins](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n0jb6sdb/Webex-LTI-Registration-Hub-for-Webex-admins).

## September 2024

### Access Registration Hub through Control Hub

Webex admins can access Registration Hub through Control Hub.

In Control Hub, go to Organization Settings \>  Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), click LTI Registration Hub, and sign in with Webex.

## July 2024

### Introducing Webex LTI

Webex LTI is a new integration that uses the latest Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard, LTI 1.3, to integrate Webex inside Learning Management Systems (LMSs). Webex LTI has the same refreshed design as Webex LTI Legacy.

In Webex LTI, instructors can:

- Schedule and host Webex meetings.
- View class meeting recordings and attendance.
- Import existing Webex recordings into a course.
- Set office hours availability.
- Create a team in the Webex App for their course, and sync their class roster to the team.

In Webex LTI, students can:

- Join Webex meetings for their class, and watch recordings of those meetings.
- View additional Webex recordings imported by their instructor.
- Schedule office hours sessions with their instructor.
- Access the Webex team created for their course.

You can install Webex LTI in any LMS that supports LTI 1.3.

To learn more about the features available in Webex LTI, see [Webex LTI for teachers](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/mey5xo).

To learn more about details on the feature similarities and differences between Webex LTI, Webex LTI Legacy, and Webex Education Connector, see [Webex LTI, Webex LTI Legacy, and Webex Education Connector feature comparison](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nbfhj9d/Webex-LTI,-Webex-LTI-Legacy,-and-Webex-Education-Connector-feature-comparison.).

For best practices for a successful migration from Webex LTI Legacy to Webex LTI, see [Best practices for Webex LTI Legacy to Webex LTI migration](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n14ya0r).

### Centralized administrative capabilities in Registration Hub

Registration Hub is a new administrative console for the management of Webex LTI and Webex LTI Legacy registrations. To access Registration Hub, you must be a Webex site admin.

Registration Hub includes the functionality previously available in the admin console of Webex Education Connector and the ability to create new registrations.

In Registration Hub, you can:

- View a list of all your Webex LTI and Webex LTI Legacy registrations in one place.
- Manage which features are available in each registration for instructors to configure for their courses.
- Create new Webex LTI registrations.  

  - A new Webex LTI registration is an opportunity to start fresh without any previous data or settings.
- Create a Webex LTI registration that is linked to an existing Webex LTI Legacy registration.

  - A linked Webex LTI registration helps with a smooth transition from Webex LTI Legacy, as the Webex LTI registration inherits the data of its linked Webex LTI Legacy registration, including courses, meetings, and recordings.
- See identifier information for each of your registrations.

To learn more about Registration Hub, see [Webex LTI Registration Hub for admins](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n0jb6sdb/).

### Team membership in Webex LTI

In Webex LTI Legacy, if the classroom collaboration feature was enabled in a course, everyone enrolled was added to the team for that course.

Now in Webex LTI, admins can indicate which **LTI context roles** are added to the course's team when classroom collaboration is enabled in a course. This is set in the Team membership section of the registration detail page.

An **LTI context role** is the role that is attributed to a user when they launch an LTI tool in their LMS. The LTI context role is not the same as a user's LMS role, though the names might be similar. Each LMS role has an associated LTI context role, but the mapping is different in each LMS. Your LMS administrator can help determine which LTI context role is associated with each LMS role.

**When you first enable classroom collaboration in a course:**

- Webex LTI creates a team when you first enable classroom collaboration in a course.
- Webex LTI automatically adds users to the team if they are enrolled in the course with a role that is checked in Team membership.
- Webex LTI does not add users to the team if they are enrolled in the course with a role that is unchecked in Team membership.

**After you've enabled classroom collaboration a course:** 

- Webex LTI includes users in the class roster sync if they are enrolled in the course with a role that is checked in Team membership.
- Webex LTI does not include users in the class roster sync if they are enrolled in the course with a role that is unchecked in Team membership.
- When an admin checks or unchecks a role, Webex LTI adds or removes class members with that role during the next membership sync. Learn more about membership sync settings for classroom collaboration in [Webex LTI for teachers](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/mey5xo).
- New class members aren't added to the team if their role is not checked in Team membership.

For Canvas admins, the Team membership functionality is still called Canvas course role access in Webex LTI Legacy registrations.

### LTI context roles in Webex LTI

Webex LTI uses LTI context roles to determine the user experience in some parts of the tool.

- Setup—If a user has the context role of instructor in the course where they launch Webex LTI, they see the Setup tab in Webex LTI. All other context roles do not see the Setup tab.
- Non-instructor roles can create meetings—If enabled in Registration Hub, all class members with a Webex Meetings license can create a meeting in their class. If disabled in Registration Hub, only class members with the instructor context role and a Webex Meetings license can create a meeting.
- Team membership—In Registration Hub, admins determine which LTI context roles are added to a course's team when classroom collaboration is enabled in a course.

## May 2024

### Webex LTI coming soon

Webex LTI is a new integration from Cisco that includes full support for Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) 1.3, new features like additional schedule options and improved recordings sync, as well as a refreshed design. 

### Automatic migration of Webex Education Connector to Webex LTI Legacy

On **Sunday, June 2, 2024**, every Webex Education Connector registration will be automatically migrated to a special version of Webex LTI, called Webex LTI Legacy.

Webex LTI Legacy will inherit many of Webex LTI's improvements, but will allow you to continue supporting LTI 1.1 environments without needing to take any action.

Following the migration, as of **Monday, June 3, 2024**, all of your courses, meetings, and settings from Webex Education Connector will be available to you and your users immediately in Webex LTI Legacy.

While you don’t need to take any action as part of this migration, please be aware that in order to use certain features that require Webex user authorization, such as scheduling new meetings, your users will need to log in with Webex again inside of Webex LTI Legacy in your LMS. 

Please see [Webex LTI, Webex LTI Legacy, and Webex Education Connector feature comparison](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nbfhj9d/Webex-LTI,-Webex-LTI-Legacy,-and-Webex-Education-Connector-feature-comparison.) for details on the feature similarities and differences between Webex LTI, Webex LTI Legacy, and Webex Education Connector.

## March 2024

### New Webex integration with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) coming soon

We’re excited to announce that a new integration between Webex and LTI-compliant Learning Management Systems is coming this calendar year. This integration will support LTI 1.3 and introduce new features as well as new UI. 

### Webex Education Connector registrations temporarily provisioned through Cisco TAC

In preparation for the release of our new LMS integration, we are no longer allowing end users to create new Webex Education Connector registrations as of March 27, 2024\. 

If you are an existing Webex customer with a current Webex Education Connector registration and need help generating new installation credentials for your LMS, please open a support case with Cisco TAC for assistance. 

If you are a new Webex customer and have not yet set up Webex Education Connector, please contact your sales or customer success representative. 

Existing Webex Education Connector installations are not affected and will operate as normal. 

[June 2024](#%5Fce2635fa-d4fe-4142-a352-9572ca7a9b17)

### June 2, 2024

### Automatic migration from Webex Education Connector to Webex LTI Legacy

On June 2, 2024, every Webex Education Connector registration was automatically migrated to Webex LTI Legacy.

Webex LTI Legacy looks different, but all the courses, meetings, and settings from Webex Education Connector are available to you and your users immediately.

While you don't need to take any action as part of this migration, please be aware that to use certain features that require Webex user authorization, such as scheduling new meetings, you must sign in with Webex inside Webex LTI Legacy in your LMS. 

Like Webex Education Connector, Webex LTI Legacy is built using Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) version 1.1\. The conversion of Webex Education Connector registrations to Webex LTI Legacy is in preparation for Webex LTI, a new integration built on LTI version 1.3\. Webex LTI will be available to you in the coming months.

Please see [Webex LTI, Webex LTI Legacy, and Webex Education Connector feature comparison](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nbfhj9d/Webex-LTI,-Webex-LTI-Legacy,-and-Webex-Education-Connector-feature-comparison.) for details on the feature similarities and differences between Webex LTI, Webex LTI Legacy, and Webex Education Connector.

Please see [Webex LTI for teachers](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/mey5xo/Webex-LTI-for-teachers#task-template%5F94b5b916-e6cd-4318-a2c4-9559d969a43b) to learn more about the features available in both Webex LTI Legacy and the upcoming new integration Webex LTI. 

### Enhanced recording syncing

We've refined and optimized the recording sync process to ensure that your recordings sync back to your LMS faster than ever. In addition to these improvements, we've added a new feature for your convenience—a manual sync option. The manual sync gives you the flexibility to update your courses with the latest meeting recordings on command.

### Import recordings from Webex

You can import Webex recordings that aren't part of a specific class meeting into your LMS using the new other recordings feature. When imported, you can to publish these recordings in any class you teach to make them available for your students.

The other recordings feature replaces the recording library feature that was available in Webex Education Connector. 

### Two-way syncing between Webex and your LMS

Webex LTI Legacy syncs changes made to your recordings in [User Hub](https://globalpage-prod.webex.com/signin) back to the LMS.

### Additional meeting scheduling options

When scheduling a Webex meeting, you have more scheduling options for the meeting:

- Join rules—Choose what happens for people who aren't on the invite or who aren't signed in:

  - They can join the meeting.
  - They wait in the lobby until they're admitted.
  - They can't join the meeting.
- Auto lock—To lock your meeting after it starts, check this check box and choose how many minutes pass before the meeting locks.
- Entry and exit tone—Choose the sound that people hear when someone joins or leaves the meeting.
- Mute attendees—Select any of the following options:

  - Allow attendees to unmute themselves in the meeting—If you choose to mute attendees when they join, select this option so they can unmute themselves.  
  Don't select this option if you want only the host or cohost to be able to unmute attendees.
  - Always mute attendees when they join the meeting—Automatically mute attendees when they join the meeting. [Allow attendees to raise their hands so that you can unmute them](https://help.webex.com/dzje8f/).
- Automatic recording—Automatically start recording when the meeting starts.

### New classroom collaboration experience

The classroom collaboration experience inside the LMS has changed. Click the classroom collaboration tab to open your class's team in the [Webex App](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n3xx7vcb/) for web. Messaging content and space creation are no longer be available directly within the LMS integration itself.

### End of support announcement

With the release of Webex LTI Legacy, we are announcing the end of support for the following features:

- **Admin console**—Site-wide administration, including the ability to enable or disable specific features, is moving out of the LMS. The new admin console will be available in an upcoming release, and we will provide more details on this new experience in future updates.
- **Analytics**—Analytics are not available within the Webex LTI Legacy integration. You can find Webex usage data and analytics in [Control Hub](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n0rlwxe/Analytics-for-Your-Cloud-Collaboration-Portfolio).
- **Grading**—Meeting attendance only displays the attendance information from User Hub, and instructors can no longer manually mark attendance. With the removal of manual attendance marking in meetings, the grading feature is no longer supported.
- **LMS calendar integration**—Meetings that are scheduled with Webex LTI Legacy must be started and joined from within the Webex LTI Legacy integration or from [User Hub](https://globalpage-prod.webex.com/signin).
- **ReminderBot**—With the enhancements to Webex's upcoming meeting notifications, the ReminderBot feature has been removed.

[December 2021](#Cisco%5FReference.dita%5F525a19e6-3da3-4786-93aa-4e5936e3f1bc)

### December 27, 2021

### Improved office hours experience

In this release, we have redesigned the Office Hours experience for both instructors and students.

**Instructor experience**

Instructors now have a clearer view of their office hours settings and availability. In the Weekly Hours tab, instructors configure their weekly availability by setting their preferred meeting duration, meeting buffer, date range, time zone, days of availability, and hours of availability. 

A Date range selector has been added that allows instructors to define a consecutive period of time for students to book office hours. Only dates within the date range that is indicated will be shown to students when scheduling. This provides the flexibility to restrict future bookings to a term, semester, or other time-defined period. 

The time zone selector allows instructors to set their preferred time zone for office hours meetings. This provides clarity and consistency for students when scheduling meetings. 

**Student experience**

We have updated the student view so that a student must first select their instructor before available time slots are displayed, so it is clear which instructor a student is scheduling time with. 

### Date override in office hours

Instructors are able to modify their availability for a specific date without needing to update their general office hours availability. Instructors can reduce their availability on a date, increase their availability on a date, or mark themselves unavailable for an entire date.

### Update time zone in office hours

The default time zone for office hours is based on the time zone in the course where an instructor first enables office hours. If instructors are located in a different time zone than this course, they can update the time zone for all their office hours. This will provide clarity and consistency when students are scheduling time to meet.

[August 2021](#Cisco%5FReference.dita%5F8b6f1275-5ee8-4d1e-9866-fe7af00b2d88)

### August 31, 2021

### Advanced Scheduling Options

When scheduling a Webex meeting in Virtual Meetings, instructors now can specify the following advanced scheduling options for the meeting:

- Unlocked Meetings—Instructors can control whether or not users outside of the school’s Webex organization can join unlocked meetings. Choose whether guests can join the meeting directly, whether they must wait in the lobby and be admitted by the host, or can't join the meeting.  
An admin must turn off the Require Account to Join setting in the Admin Panel to allow instructors to set the unlocked meetings behavior. Enabling Require Account to Join prevents anyone without an account on the school's Webex site from joining meetings.
- Automatic Lock—Automatically lock meetings after the meeting starts.
- Automatic Recording—Automatically start recording when the meeting starts.

### Branding Updates

We updated references and branding from **Webex Teams** to **Webex** in Classrooms Collaboration, Setup, and Admin Panel. For more information about the Webex Suite branding, see [New Webex Suite and Branding](https://help.webex.com/jil5i/).

[February 2021](#Cisco%5FReference.dita%5Fa1df2461-9728-4a53-8bda-d7f083eec0d6)

### February 15, 2021

### Token Expiration

Prior to this release, you received a prompt to sign in to Webex from within Virtual Meetings when scheduling or modifying a meeting. With this release, you're prompted to sign in to Webex whenever you use Virtual Meetings with an expired Webex access token. Ensuring that your token is active improves the syncing of recordings.

### February 2, 2021

### Modifications to Recordings for Virtual Meetings

Previously, only recordings for meetings hosted from within the Webex Education Connector appeared in the Recordings section of Virtual Meetings. Now, any meetings scheduled through Virtual Meetings appear in the Virtual Meetings Recordings, regardless of whether they were hosted from Webex Education Connector.

[January 2021](#Cisco%5FReference.dita%5Fc06ec445-3de9-4c67-b0c5-1901483f8d41)

### January 22, 2021

### Canvas Role Support in Classroom Collaboration

Prior to this release, if Classroom Collaboration was turned on for a course, everyone enrolled was added to the team for that course.

Canvas Admins can now indicate which roles have access to Classroom Collaboration. In the Admin Panel, admins can uncheck any roles that they don’t want to have access to Classroom Collaboration for the courses in which the feature is enabled.

 When an admin unchecks a role, the Webex Education Connector removes anyone in the team who doesn't have an approved role during the next membership sync. New people who enroll aren't added to the team if they don't have an approved role.

[September 2020](#id%5F138706)

### September 30, 2020

### Recording Library

Available for Canvas, D2L, Moodle, Sakai, and Schoology. Instructors may have recordings of their Webex meetings that they can reuse for future semesters or in other class offerings. The recording library allows instructors to create recordings and publish it for students in other classes. Administrators can control the availability of the recording library from the Admin Console.

The recording library includes the following options:

- Instructors can view and delete their own recordings.
- Instructors can host a meeting within a course and make a recording of it without making the meeting visible to students.
- Instructors can make a private recording of a meeting and share it with students in a one class or multiple classes.
- Students can view recorded meetings that the instructor shared with them.

### Attendance

Instructors may want to see who joined their Webex meetings and when they joined through their LMS. They can take attendance in each meeting, indicate excused absences, and assign a grade for students based on their attendance. Attendance is taken only for students who join through the LMS.

The attendance features include the following options:

- Instructors can view attendance for each meeting.
- Instructors can indicate excused absences from meetings, which count as the student being present in the grade calculation.
- Instructors can choose whether to grade a meeting or not.
- Instructors can export an attendance report for their meetings as a CSV file.

### Edit Recurring Meetings

Now, instructors can make edits to their recurring meetings.

[July 2020](#id%5F137207)

### July 14, 2020

### Removal of Required Authorization Step in Meetings—Canvas, Moodle, D2L

Prior to this release, instructors or administrators needed to authorize the application in the Setup tab before using Virtual Meetings or Office Hours. In this release, we’ve made authorization optional for using Virtual Meetings and Office Hours.

When an instructor attempts to create a Virtual Meeting for the first time and the application isn’t authorized with the LMS, they’re prompted to authorize the application. They can choose to authorize or opt out.

If the instructor authorizes the application, meetings created via Virtual Meetings sync to the LMS calendar and they can activate the grading features. Office Hours are available.

If the instructor chooses not to authorize the application, meetings created via Virtual Meetings don’t sync with the LMS calendar, and the grading feature is disabled. An instructor can authorize the application later and have historical and future Virtual Meetings sync with the LMS calendar. Office Hours are available when the instructor opts out of authorizing.

There’s no change to authorization for Classroom Collaboration. Authorization via the Setup tab is required for using Classroom Collaboration.

### Removal of Required Authorization Step in Meetings—Blackboard Learn, Blackboard Ultra, Sakai

Prior to this release, instructors and administrators needed to authorize the application in the Setup tab prior to using Webex Education Connector functionality. In this release, we’ve removed the requirement to authorize the application to use Virtual Meetings and Office Hours. Authorization via the Setup tab is required for Classroom Collaboration in Blackboard and Sakai and use of the Grading Feature in Blackboard.

### Time Zone Modifications

With this release, instructors or administrators don’t need to sync the time zone first from the Setup tab. They can directly create meetings without clicking Sync for Time Zone and Authorize. Instructors can view and change their time zone from the Setup tab and have that time zone apply to the course. If the time zone changes in the course, it only affects future meetings in that course. Prior meetings aren’t changed.

### July 1, 2020

### New Recordings Tab in Virtual Meetings

We’ve moved recordings to a new Recordings Tab within Virtual Meetings. The Recordings Tab lists all recordings for meetings initiated from within the Webex Education Connector. The new Recordings Tab also resolves previous issues with Recordings syncing to the Webex Education Connector.

[May 2020](#id%5F136271)

### May 19, 2020

### Additional Functionality on the LMS Integration Admin Panel

The Admin Panel is only available in Canvas, Moodle, D2L, and Sakai.

We've added the following options in the Admin Panel so that LMS administrators can define LMS site-wide settings:

- Office Hours: Admins can make office hours available or unavailable to instructors.
- Non-instructor roles creating meetings: Admins can disable the ability for non-instructor roles to create meetings.
- Custom Support URL: Admins can specify their own custom support URL in place of the standard Webex Education Connector support URL.

### Modifications to Virtual Meetings

We've modified the format of the time zone when scheduling a meeting so that it's is more consistent with the formatting in Webex.

[April 2020](#id%5F134745)

### April 13, 2020

### LMS Integration Admin Panel

The Admin Panel is only available in Canvas, Moodle, D2L, and Sakai.

We've added the Admin Panel in the Setup tab for each course in Webex Education Connector.

LMS administrators can use the Admin Panel to define feature availability for all courses in the LMS, and see usage across all courses. Take a look at the tabs in the Admin Panel below: 

**Settings**—LMS administrators can specify which features to enable for instructors and students in the Webex Education Connector.

**Analytics**—View top level metrics for usage within the Webex Education Connector. 

Webex site administrators can access all site-wide analytics from Site Administration or Control Hub.

**Virtual Meetings**—View all virtual meeting recordings for meetings initiated within the Webex Education Connector.

[March 2020](#id%5F134321)

### March 28, 2020

### Status Page

We're providing a status page to inform customers of any downtime: [https://status.educonnector.io](http://status.educonnector.io/).

### Design Update

The new look and feel matches the Webex Meetings and Webex App experience.

### Improved Webex App Onboarding Experience

When an instructor enables Webex App, a team for the course is automatically created.

### Improved Classroom Collaboration Performance

Fixed an issue where users saw messages, "Unable to load space" or "Conversation not available" when switching spaces.

### Canvas: Team Creation per Section

When instructors launch Classroom Collaboration in Canvas for the first time, a team for each section is automatically created. This way students can interact within the course team, or within the team specifically for their section. For instructors who are already using Classroom Collaboration in Canvas, a new team will be created for each section upon the next synchronization.
